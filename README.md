# 🫀 Predicting Heart Attack Risks Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict heart attack risks 1-2 weeks in advance based on patient data. By analyzing key health indicators, the model aims to provide early warnings, aiding in preventive healthcare.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** `heart.csv` from "https://www.kaggle.com/code/gmzyakut/heart-disease-heart-csv-example-for-data-science"
- **Features:** Age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, exercise-induced angina, and other cardiovascular indicators.
- **Goal:** Achieve a **75-95% accuracy** in predicting heart attack risks.
